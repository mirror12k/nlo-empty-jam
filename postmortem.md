# the good
- visuals are pretty
- combat is simple and easy to understand

# the bad
- visuals took too long to make for a 3 day gamejam
- combat doesnt have depth or variety
- project is unfinished (store incomplete, level generation, progress)
- focused too much on the visuals, didn't complete the core mechanics/theme
- spent too much time optimizing visuals
- no explanation of the core mechanics

# the future
- flesh out the mechanics first!
- make a complete game first, then work on the visuals
- understand the engine better
- get better at prioritizing the list (if a bullet point fails)
- learn to work with the core things instead of visuals (core mechanics don't change)
